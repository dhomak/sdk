## Introduction

Foliage is an open-source collaborative platform that uses a distributed graph database, offering a unified, extensible environment for automation, cross-domain connectivity, and high-performance, edge-friendly runtimes. It provides a robust foundation for IoT solutions, automation workflows, and edge computing applications.

## Core Concepts

### Abstract

Foliage introduces abstraction, where knowledge about complex systems converges into a unified space, promoting transparent understanding and blurring the boundary between system models and the system itself.

![Abstract](./docs/pics/FoliageUnification.jpg)

### Features

Foliage promotes transparency, consistency, and clarity among system components by consolidating knowledge from diverse domains into a unified space. It reveals hidden dependencies, simplifying system evaluation and relationship management.

## Getting Started

### Minimum Requirements

**Native Install**

Foliage platform native install requirements correspond to the NATS Jetstream installations requirements listed here:  
https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/introduction/installation#with-jetstream

Same is for supported OS:  
https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/introduction/installation#with-jetstream

**Docker Container Install**

Foliage platform install via docker requires as minimal resources as docker engine itself:
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/

### Installation

To begin using Foliage, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/foliagecp/sdk.git
```

For detailed installation instructions and prerequisites, visit the [official documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/foliagecp/sdk).

### Health Status Check

1. Check that NATS server and Foliage runtime are running fine:
```sh
% docker ps

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                      COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                                                    NAMES
...
b5a2deb84082   foliage-sdk-tests:latest   "/usr/bin/tests basic"   11 minutes ago   Up 11 minutes                                                                            tests-runtime-1
fac8d1bfef3a   nats:latest                "/nats-server -js -sâ€¦"   11 minutes ago   Up 11 minutes   0.0.0.0:4222->4222/tcp, 0.0.0.0:6222->6222/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8222->8222/tcp   tests-nats-1
``` 

2. Check that NATS server is running fine:
```sh
% docker logs tests-nats-1

...
[1] 2023/10/16 09:00:43.094325 [INF] Server is ready
```

3. Check that Foliage runtime runs without errors:
```sh
% docker logs tests-runtime-1 | grep "error" -i
```


### Running Tests

Foliage provides a set of test samples to help you get familiar with the platform. Follow these steps to run them:

#### 1. Navigate to `tests`:

```sh
cd tests
```

#### 2. Build the tests runtime:

```sh
docker-compose build
```

#### 3. Modify the `.env` file:

Customize the test environment by editing the `.env` file. For the basic test, find it at `./basic/.env`.

#### 4. Start the tests:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

To select a different test sample, set the TEST_NAME environment variable before running docker-compose up -d. The basic test sample starts by default.

#### 5. Stop and clean up:

When you're done testing, stop and clean up the environment:

```sh
docker-compose down -v
```

### Customization

Explore available test samples and customize them to gain insights into Foliage's development principles. Refer to [basic test sample documentation](./docs/tests/basic.md).

For statefun logic definition, consider using plugins like [JavaScript](./docs/plugins/js.md).

## Development

### Working with the SDK

Use SDK To develop applications with Foliage:

```sh
go get github.com/foliagecp/sdk
```
